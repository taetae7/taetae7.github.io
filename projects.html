					<h2>Developer for RGBudget (Currently in development)</h2>
					<h5>function: users can input daily expenses and keep track of their spending</h5>
					<p>
						Code Name: RGBudget (App Icon coming soon) is a simple application where the user can set a monthly budget
						and see their spending with just a glance. The objective of this application is for its simplicity: users will easily be able
						to navigate and get the information. On the main screen, the app lets the user know how much money they have left to spend for remainder
						of the month. The user can click on any date in the calendar and add a description and amount. The user can then click on the circle to the left
						to indicate a "loss" or "gain" and the app will automatically calculate the net total.

					<h2>FOUNDER at DIGITALAGE</h2>

					<h5>role: Founder, Web Developer, Finance, and other</h5>
					<p>
						DigitalAge is a online store created my me and my friend during the pandemic.
						Started as a concept, we managed to create a unique, trending korean-fashion that is inexpensive and attractive.
						With just the two of us, we learned various ways of running a small online business such as shipping and logistic,
						or online marketing. For me, I was able to learn basic JavaScript and enhance my HTML and CSS skills. As seen
						with the link above, the fully functional ecommerce site was created by me from scratch. I also designed
						the website with the concept of the business.
