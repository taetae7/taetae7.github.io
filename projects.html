					<h2>FOUNDER at DIGITALAGE</h2>
					<h3><a href="https://digitalagestore.com">https://digitalagestore.com</a></h3>
					<h5>role: Founder, Web Developer, Finance, and other</h5>
					<p>
						DigitalAge is a post-COVID19 online store created my me and my friend.
						Started as a concept, we managed to create a unique, trending korean-fashion that is inexpensive and attractive.
						With just the two of us, we learned various ways of running a small online business such as shipping and logistic,
						or online marketing. For me, I was able to learn JavaScript and enhance my HTML and CSS skills. As seen
						with the link above, the fully functional ecommerce site was created by me from scratch. I also designed
						the website with the concept of the business.
