					<p>
						Jjin Jjajang is my family-owned business in which I helped my parents. Some of the things I have helped with

						With years of experience at restaurants my parents and I were able to open a Korean-Chinese fusion establishment.
						Because of the pandemic, I focused heavily on marketing and learned how to manage online platform from Yelp, Google, 
						some food delivery services, and social media. Despite COVID-19, We were sucessfully able to attact copious customers
						and provide excellent service.

					<h2>FOUNDER at DIGITALAGE</h2>
					<h3><a href="https://digitalagestore.com">https://digitalagestore.com</a></h3>
					<h5>role: Founder, Web Developer, Finance, and other</h5>
					<p>
						DigitalAge is a post-COVID19 online store created my me and my friend.
						Started as a concept, we managed to create a unique, trending korean-fashion that is inexpensive and attractive.
						With just the two of us, we learned various ways of running a small online business such as shipping and logistic,
						or online marketing. For me, I was able to learn JavaScript and enhance my HTML and CSS skills. As seen
						with the link above, the fully functional ecommerce site was created by me from scratch. I also designed
						the website with the concept of the business.
